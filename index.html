    <p>To start off, ROM hacking is not actually hacking but it's editing. When ROM hacking, you edit the ROM files to be able to change features of a video game.
     Some examples of those features would be dialogue, graphics, maps, and storyline.</p>

     <h2 id="hacking-methods">Methods to ROM Hacks</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>Hex Editing: Mainly used to edit texts.</li>
        <li>Graphics Editing: Changing the look of the video game's environments, characters, fonts, and so much more.</li>
        <li>Palette Editing: Changes the color values in the game.</li>
        <li>Data Editing: Changes the data of characters, items, and possible enemies.</li>
        <li>Assembly Hacking: Most powerful and difficuly hacking technique. The official process is called ASM hacking, which is editing the game's actual code.</li>
        <li>Music Hacking: One of the most rarest hack to use because it's difficult to find music data to modify it, and porting music from another game.</li>
        <li>ROM Expansion: This increases the ROM image so there would be more room for content to make a larger game. </li>
    <p> 
        There are so much more types of methods that are used to create a ROM hacks. If you're interested, I recommend going to ROM hack forums to learn more about them.
    </p>   
     </ul>
     

     <h2 id="hacking-systems">Systems and Games</h2>
     <p>Majority of systems that are ROM hacked are NES and SNES games because they are simple to edit compared to recent consoles(does not mean they can not be hacked). Many hacks have been released using the Sonic the hedgehog series, Super Mario series, Pokemon series, and many others.</p>
