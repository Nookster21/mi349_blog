    <p>To start off, congrats on starting your crochet journey! Crocheting is a fun, relaxing hobby that anyone can do! On this website, we will talk about the basics of crocheting.
    </p>

     <h2 id="hacking-methods">What do you need to start crocheting?</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>Crochet hooks: comes in a range of sizes and shapes, but the most important thing to remember is to match the size of the hook with the yarn (use larger crochet hooks with thicker yarn and vise virsa).</li>
        <li>Yarn: Comes in many different weights and textures because different patterns will recommend various types of yarns.<em>Would recommend a medium weight cotton yarn! </em></li>
        <li>Yarn Needle</li>
        <li>Data Editing: Changes the data of characters, items, and possible enemies.</li>
        <li>Assembly Hacking: Most powerful and difficuly hacking technique. The official process is called ASM hacking, which is editing the game's actual code.</li>
        <li>Music Hacking: One of the most rarest hack to use because it's difficult to find music data to modify it, and porting music from another game.</li>
        <li>ROM Expansion: This increases the ROM image so there would be more room for content to make a larger game. </li>
    <p> 
       <em>There are different types of methods that are used to create a ROM hacks. If you're interested, I recommend going to ROM hack forums to learn more about them.</em> 
    </p>   
     </ul>
     

     <h2 id="hacking-systems">Systems and Games</h2>
     <p>Majority of systems that are ROM hacked are NES and SNES games because they are simple to edit compared to recent consoles(does not mean they can not be hacked). Many hacks have been released using the Sonic the hedgehog series, Super Mario series, Pokemon series, and many others.</p>
