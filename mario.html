    <h1>First Polished SMW ROM Hack: Kaizo Mario World</h1>
    <p>Kaizo Mario world is a series of three ROM hacks of Super Mario World on the SNES.
        It was made in 2007 by the creator, Takemoto, who made it for a friend. The meaning of "Kaizo" is a Japanese term which translates to reorganized(which is what ROM hacks are all about), but in this sense it is used to describe the level's difficulty. What makes this hack unique is the challenging levels that constantly keeps players on their toes. Although this ROM hack keeps the same game mechanics, it pushes the players skill levels and creativity in each scene. This series is known for doing speedruns or Let's Plays.

    <h2>Kaizo ROM Hacks</h2>

    <p>Because of this infamous hack, Kaizo is now a subgenre of challenging levels that pushes the player, but have the balance of having fun.
        To play these types of hacks you have to have patience because every 15 seconds something will try to kill you. Luckily, there are more hacks that have a wide spectrum of difficulties, so players can start off somewhere. When watching a skilled player play SMW ROM hack, it looks very easy, but trust me when I say it's one of the hardest games I have ever played.
