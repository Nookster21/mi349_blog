    <h1>First Polished SMW ROM Hack: Kaizo Mario World</h1>
    <p>Kaizo Mario world is a series of three ROM hacks of Super Mario World on the SNES.
        The creator of the hack is Takemoto, who made it for a friend. The meaning of "Kaizo" is a Japanese term which translates to reorganized(which is what ROM hacks are all about), but in this sense it is used to describe the level's difficulty. What makes this hack unique is the challenging levels that constantly keeps players on their toes. Although this ROM hack keeps the same game mechanics, it pushes the players skill levels and creativity in each scene. This series is known for doing speedruns or Let's Plays.
