    <h2>Scarf</h2>
    <p>It's one of the first pieces I have made to master basic stitches. When you think about it, scarfs are just a long rectangle and is straight forward. Someone that can help you learn step by step is a lovely YouTuber names Sewrella!</p>

    <h2>Chunky Ribbed Crochet Beanie</h2>
    <p>
        Beanies make a great gift for family or for yourself! This requires chunky yarn, so the hat is warm and cozy (perfect for Michigan weather right now). It will take less than a bulk of yarn and a little bit more of a challenge from a scarf.
        forthefrills makes a wonderful tutorial on the beanies. It's simple and a quick watch, so please check it out!
