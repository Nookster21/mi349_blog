    <h2>Kaizo ROM Hacks</h2>

    <p>Because of this infamous hack, Kaizo is now a subgenre of challenging levels that pushes the player, but have the balance of having fun.

Luckily, there are more hacks that have a wide spectrum of difficulties, so players can start off somewhere. When watching a skilled player play SMW ROM hack, it looks very easy, but trust me when I say it's one of the hardest games I have ever played.
