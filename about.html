      <h2>Q&A Time!</h2>

      <h3>Why Did I Make My Blog About ROM Hacks?</h3>
      <p>I randomly found out about it a couple of months ago and thought that I could learn more if I write about it.</p>

      <h3>What is Your Favorite Color?</h3>
      <p>
        I do not have just one favorite color, so let me make a list :)
      </p>
      <ul class="burdown"> 
        <li>Pink</li> 
        <li> Purple</li>
        <li> Green</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em> In this exact order!</em></p>

    <h3>What is Your Favorite Food?</h3>
    <p>I like either a creamy alfredo pasta or a bacon cheeseburger with caramelized onions!</p>

    <h3>What Game are You Currently Playing?</h3>
    <p>Right now I am playing <em>Hollow Knight</em> and it is been very tough! There's something trying to attack me all the time, but atleast my character is cute.</p>

    <h3>What Do You Plan to Do After College?</h3>
    <p>I hope to get an internship at EA Games after I graduate and possibly gain enough experience to work at Nintendo(or indie game company)! Another option is to become a freelance 3D modeler where I just create whatever people commission me for. </p>
