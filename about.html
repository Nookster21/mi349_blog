      <p> 
        Yarnia is a global online blog, where creatives come to learn how to crochet for free!
      </p>
      
      <h2>Q&A Time!</h2>

      <h3>Why was Yarnia Created?</h3>
      <p>Yarnia creates a knitted world where people from beginners, intermediate, or experienced skill levels can find free patterns. You can also buy handcraft pieces that people have created if youâ€™re not interested in making them yourselves. Our company is made from crochet lovers who want everyone to have an easy way to find ways to get into crocheting, and expose more smaller businesses!</p>

      <h3>What is Your Favorite Color?</h3>
      <p>
        I do not have just one favorite color, so let me make a list :)
      </p>
      <ul class="burdown"> 
        <li>Pink</li> 
        <li> Purple</li>
        <li> Green</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em> In this exact order!</em></p>

    <h3>What is Your Favorite Food?</h3>
    <p>I like either a creamy alfredo pasta or a bacon cheeseburger with caramelized onions!</p>

    <h3>What Game are You Currently Playing?</h3>
    <p>Right now I am playing <em>Hollow Knight</em> and it is been very tough! There's something trying to attack me all the time, but atleast my character is cute.</p>

    <h3>What Do You Plan to Do After College?</h3>
    <p>I hope to get an internship at EA Games after I graduate and possibly gain enough experience to work at Nintendo(or indie game company)! Another option is to become a freelance 3D modeler where I just create whatever people commission me for. </p>
