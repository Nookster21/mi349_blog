      <h2>Q&A Time!</h2>

      <h3>Why was Yarnia Created?</h3>
      <p>Yarnia creates a knitted world where people from beginners, intermediate, or experienced skill levels can find free patterns. You can also buy handcraft pieces that people have created if youâ€™re not interested in making them yourselves. Our company is made from crochet lovers who want everyone to have an easy way to find ways to get into crocheting, and expose more smaller businesses!</p>

    <h3>Will I get the some deals?</h3>
    <p>We will make announcements when we collab with other crocheters and gives the best deals for patterns or crocheted pieces.</p>

    <!-- <h3>What Game are You Currently Playing?</h3>
    <p>Right now I am playing <em>Hollow Knight</em> and it is been very tough! There's something trying to attack me all the time, but atleast my character is cute.</p>

    <h3>What Do You Plan to Do After College?</h3>
    <p>I hope to get an internship at EA Games after I graduate and possibly gain enough experience to work at Nintendo(or indie game company)! Another option is to become a freelance 3D modeler where I just create whatever people commission me for. </p> -->
